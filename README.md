## Description

_This is a backend project I created for my B.S. in Software Engineering that manages a vacation booking website. The
user is able to create users for checkout and ascribe a vacation package. They are also able to select different
countries and apply excursions to that trip. Upon checkout the user is provided a total and a confirmation number for
their order. Developing this application helped me grow my understanding of Java and HTML_
